Hi there, I'm Matheus Massara!👋

I come from a background in Law, but it was in technology that I found my true space for creativity and purpose. Changing careers was a conscious decision — I wanted to solve problems creatively, build useful solutions, and positively impact people's lives.

I've always been curious about tech, and diving into the world of web development was a natural step. Since then, I've been studying and working on projects focused on modern web applications, both on the front-end and back-end.

I'm driven by continuous learning and believe in the power of collaboration. I'm constantly working to grow not just as a developer, but as a professional who values purpose in everything I build.

I'm currently open to connections, collaborations, and opportunities that lead to mutual growth. 🚀
